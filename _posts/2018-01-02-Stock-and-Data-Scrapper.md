This project came from a desire to learn to webscrape and to get better at coding in python. The project itself is not overly complicated,
but it was an introduction into using python, pip, and webscrapping. The choice to scrape stocks came in part from a need for a significant
amount of data to scrape and in part because of personal intrest. 

Alot  of time spent writing this code was sifting through HTML code for where yahoo finance stores there data and finding the best way to 
extract it. I am aware that a Yahoo finance API exists, but I choose not to use it (even though it would have been more efficent) mainly
because I wanted experience with making my own scrapper so that I could apply the skills for webscrapping to other projects in the future. 

Seeing as I have little to no experience in the world of bussiness and choosing stocks, I have considered expanding the project to use 
machine learning algorithms rather than simply using the xlsx package to bring the data into excel. The end goal of this being to use the 
code to help me with my own investment portfolio and possibly others. I do have a small amount of experience with using a handful of 
machine learning packages in python and have considered attempting to integrate some of them (or prephaps write my own) to track stocks.
