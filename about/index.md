## Who am I?
I am a junior at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and pursuing a second major in the philosophy-neuroscience-psychology program. To say the least, I love computer science! I spend most of my free time learning new programming
langauges and frameworks, doing coding challenges, and creating new projects. I have real world experience as a software engineer, tutor, teaching assistant, and researcher. When I am not writing or talking about code, I can be found at the gym, standing on my hands, or writing philosophy papers.
