## Who am I?
I am a student at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and pursuing a second major in the philosophy-neuroscience-psychology program. People often ask me why those two areas? All too often I hear computer science majors complaining about humanities and writing courses and having to take classes that do not revolve around math. I think that this is a serious problem in STEM today. A math proof is only as good as the person who wrote it's explanation, and a computer scientist is useless if the writer cannot communicate, cooperate, and think creatively and critically. I believe my experiences with both computer science and various disciplines across cognitive science like psychology, philosophy, anthropolgy, linguistics, and neuroscience have helped me cultivate the technical as well as the creative skills necessary to meet the demands of an evolving industry.  

I often find myself tasked with using both sides of my brain: flipping between philosophy readings and java code, between algorithm analysis and psychology research. This constant back and forth keeps both my invaluable technical skills as well as my creative skills sharp. Too often, I see people neglect their creative side or their soft skills when problem solving, but my work in two worlds has thaught me that in order to be successfull in this day and age, one musts have both strong technical and creative skills. Finding this overlap opens up infinite possibilities in the relm of both problem solving and work between disciplines.

## Why Interdisciplinary?
Technology changes. Buzzwords come and go, but the need to solve problems is always there. Problem solving is the core of computer science and every STEM discipline. In my experiences, the skills used to solve problems in computer science apply across disciplines. I used to think philosophy was something for only academia: that it had no real value outside of a niche group of people and it certainly could not help me with computer science. However, after taking my first philosophy course, I found that making a philosophical argument and a code are not all that different. They both begin on a few concrete ideas and then extrapolate and build upon their foundations. They require the same logic based reasoning, and seek to reach a conclusion through logic and problem solving. 

Later on in my interdisciplinary studies, I found myself in psychology, linguistics, and anthropology courses, and was greeted with similar ideas. Again, the problem solving and reason I had learned in computer science could be transferred to other fields of studies. Likewise, the technology and skills I learned in computer science could be applied to solve problems in other areas. I found myself looking for ways to construct algorithms to run my statistics for psychology or to do my phonetic analysis for linguistics. I saw hundreds of areas where computer science could be applied, but no one at my university seemed to be taking advantage of it. Everyone in computer science seemed set on just that, computer science, when in reality the skills in computer science and in many other disciplines are largely the same and the potential to integrate computer science with other disciplines is infinite. That is why I pursue interdisciplinary studies.
