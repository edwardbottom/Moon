## Who am I?
I am a student at Washington University in St. Louis studying computer science and pursuing a second major in the philosophy-neuroscience-psychology program. People often ask me why those two area? I believe that the two areas, computer science and cognitive science work are a powerful combination. All too often I hear computer science majors complaining about humanities and writing courses and having to take classes that do not revolve arond math. I think that this is a serious problem in STEM today. A math proof is only as good as the person who wrote it's explanation, and a computer scientist is useless if the writer cannot communicate and cooperate. 

I often find myself tasked with using both sides of my brain: flipping between philosophy readings and java code, between matrix algebra and linguistics. This constant back and forth keeps both my invaluable technical skills as well as my creative skills sharp. Too often, I see people neglect their creative side or their soft skills when problem solving, but my work in two worlds has thaught me that in order to be successfull in this day and age, one musts have both strong technical and creative skills. Finding this overlap opens up infinite possibilities in the relm of both problem solving and work between disciplines.
